    <h2>Intresting facts</h2>
    <p>1.Camel can move easily across the sand because of its specially designed feet. 
        Camel's foot consists of two toes that spread when animal touches the ground 
        and prevents sinking in the sand.</p>
    <p>2.Camel can survive without food and water long period of time. Most mammals would die if they lose 15% of their water (critical loss of water is called dehydration), but camel can lose of 20-25% water without becoming dehydrated.</p>
    <p>3.Camels can run 40 miles per hour.</p>

    <h2>Intresting facts</h2>
    <p>1.Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow some chameleon species to change their skin color, creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, yellow and purple.</p>
    <p>2.Chameleon change color for camouflage but this is not always the main reason. Some show darker colors when angry, or when trying to scare others. Males show light multi-colored patterns when vying for female attention. Desert varieties change to black when its cooler to absorb heat, then a light grey to reflect heat.</p>
    <p>3.The chameleons' eyes can rotate and focus separately on 180-degree arcs, so they can see two different objects at the same time. This gives them a full 360-degree field of vision.</p>
